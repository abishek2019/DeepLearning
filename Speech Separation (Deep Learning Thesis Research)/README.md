<h2>Speech Separation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h2><p> In this research, the speech separation task was performed with the Libri2Mix dataset. Major contributions include:
 
 -  developed a speech separation model using a baseline [Conv-TasNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454) as the generator and a deep convolutional network as the discriminator. <br>
-  incorporated GAN variants based on the objective functions (Vanilla GAN, Least Squares GAN, and Metric GAN) for model training.<br>
-  established a uniform evaluation framework to compare each GAN performance over the baseline model. 
 <br><br>


Results from the baseline model and each of the GAN models are shown below (which depicts a small section of the waveform of a separated speech):
